**IMPORTANT
All that needs to be done is run the code. Any changes to equations or values happen within the editor, not the console.
When writting equations for evalExpression and postfix, put a space between each number and/or operator. The program will fail otherwise

STEP BY STEP:
	Run the program and the default operations will run. 
	Populates a custom minstack object with 1 and -1, in that order, then prints the top value and the lowest value before popping the top value and repeating for the next value. Coincidentally, the top values and minimum values match, just in this special case
	Then evaluates the expression 23+1+8*3+0/5, which comes out to 48.
	Then takes the same equation in postfix notation and solves it, again returning 48
