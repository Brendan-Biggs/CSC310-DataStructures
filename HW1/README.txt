IMPORTANT**
Do not launch the program in any IDE or other programming environment, or you will be unable to force an EOFError
Furthermore, in order to force an EOFError, you must enter ctrl+z, and only ctrl+z. ctrl+d will not force the error


STEP BY STEP*
After launching the program(by double clicking the file), you will be presented with a number based menu. Type the number cooresponding to what you want to do, and press enter.

In all cases follow prompts which will appear on screen

If you chose option 1, the program will prompt you to enter a string. It will continue to do so until you trigger an EOFError by typing Ctrl+Z and try to enter that as your string, at which point it will print out all lines that you had entered, in the opposite order you had entered them in

If you chose option 2, you will be prompted to choose how many numbers you want to compare. After you have entered your numbers, the program will print out a list of all your numbers and then print "True" if any of them can be multiplied together to produce an odd number and "False" if they cannot

If you chose option 3, you will again be asked about the size of the list you would like to create, and the program will have you build that list. Afterwards, it will print out all possible permutations of the list

If you chose option 4, you will be prompted to enter 2 integers ranging between 0 and 255. After you've entered those numbers, the program will tell you the number of bits that are different in the binary representation of the two numbers

If you chose option 5, the program will close.
