All that needs to be done for this program is that you must run it. Everything happens automatically and in order to change it, the code itself must be changed

STEP BY STEP:
First, The program builds the unordered array {1,6,3,7,5,9}. Then, it adds each item into a priority queue, in the spot where the queue remains sorted. After that, it prints out the array.

The second part of the program builds the array {12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7}, which is then fed into a heapsort object. The heapsort object prints the array, sorts it, then prints it again.

The third portion of the assignment is primarily driven by a BinHeap class. The program inserts the values 5, 7, 3, and 11 into the heap, and removes them in increasing order
